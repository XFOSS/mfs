# MFS Engine Overview

## Architecture

MFS is built on a modular layered architecture designed for flexibility and performance. The engine is organized into several major subsystems that can work independently or together to create sophisticated applications.

### Core Systems

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Core** | Base utilities, memory management, data structures, and platform abstraction |
| **Graphics** | Low-level rendering API abstraction and backend implementations |
| **Render** | High-level rendering systems, materials, pipelines, and techniques |
| **Physics** | Collision detection, resolution, and physical simulation |
| **Audio** | Sound playback, mixing, spatial audio, and DSP effects |
| **Input** | Unified input handling for keyboard, mouse, gamepad, and touch |
| **UI** | User interface components and windowing system |
| **Scene** | Scene graph, entity management, and hierarchical transforms |

## Graphics Pipeline

MFS uses a modern rendering architecture with multiple backend implementations:

1. **Frontend API** - Unified interface for all graphics operations
2. **Backend Implementations** - Vulkan, DirectX 11/12, Metal, OpenGL, etc.
3. **Render Graph** - Resource tracking, dependency resolution, and optimization
4. **Material System** - Physically-based rendering, custom shaders, and effects

The rendering system supports both forward and deferred rendering paths, with configurable post-processing effects.

## Memory Management

MFS employs a carefully designed memory management system:

- **Allocator Interface** - Pluggable allocator system (general purpose, arena, pool, etc.)
- **Resource Handles** - Indirect resource access to support hot reloading and memory defragmentation
- **Memory Tracking** - Debug tools for tracking allocations, leaks, and usage patterns
- **Asset Streaming** - Asynchronous resource loading and management

## Performance Considerations

The engine is optimized for performance through:

- **SIMD Math** - Vectorized math operations for performance-critical code paths
- **Job System** - Multi-threaded task execution with work stealing
- **Data-Oriented Design** - Cache-friendly data layouts and processing
- **Profiling Tools** - Built-in instrumentation and visualization

## Hot Reloading

MFS supports hot reloading of:

- **Shaders** - Compiled on-the-fly when source files change
- **Assets** - Textures, models, and other resources can be modified at runtime
- **Scripts** - Logic can be updated without application restart
- **Configuration** - Engine parameters can be adjusted dynamically

## Cross-Platform Support

The engine is designed to run on multiple platforms:

- **Desktop** - Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Mobile** - iOS, Android
- **Web** - WebAssembly/WebGPU
- **Embedded** - Raspberry Pi and similar devices

## Extension System

MFS provides several ways to extend functionality:

- **Plugins** - Dynamically loaded modules that extend engine capabilities
- **Custom Subsystems** - Your own systems can integrate with the engine core
- **Shader Pipeline** - Custom material and shader implementations
- **Scripting** - Embed scripting languages for gameplay logic

## Debugging and Development

The engine includes several tools for development:

- **Tracy Integration** - Detailed performance profiling
- **Debug Visualization** - Physics, bounding volumes, and other debug overlays
- **Logging** - Structured, filterable logging system
- **Asset Pipeline** - Tools for processing and optimizing assets

## Resource Management

Assets and resources are managed through:

- **Virtual File System** - Abstract file access with mounting points
- **Asset Database** - Metadata tracking and dependency management
- **Resource Cache** - Optimized loading and unloading based on usage
- **Hot Reloading** - Runtime updates of assets without restarting

## Future Roadmap

The engine continues to evolve with planned features:

- Enhanced raytracing support
- Advanced global illumination techniques
- Extended animation systems
- AI and navigation improvements
- Extended platform support
