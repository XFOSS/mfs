## Next Priorities

1. **Graphics System Completion** - Unify backend management and optimize rendering pipeline
2. **Engine Core Cleanup** - Refactor main engine loop and state management  
3. **Physics Optimization** - Improve performance and add advanced constraints
4. **UI Framework** - Complete the modern UI system
5. **Tool Suite** - Finish asset processor and visual editor

## Technical Debt Addressed

- Removed ~50 redundant documentation files
- Eliminated duplicate code files
- Cleaned up build artifacts
- Updated file references in build system
- Established clear module boundaries
- Reduced maintenance overhead significantly

## Breaking Changes

- `src/root.zig` removed - use `src/mod.zig` directly
- `src/nyx_std.zig` removed - use standard Zig std library
- Some file paths updated in build system
- Excessive status documentation removed
