# MFS Engine Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines our strategy for incrementally refactoring the MFS Engine codebase to improve maintainability, performance, and developer experience.

## Goals
1. Modernize Vulkan backend implementation
2. Improve memory management system
3. Standardize error handling
4. Clean up deprecated code
5. Improve documentation

## Approach
We'll use a "strangler fig" pattern for this refactoring:
1. Create new implementations alongside existing code
2. Gradually migrate functionality to new implementations
3. Remove old code only after new code is proven

## Phase 1: Memory Management (Current)
- [x] Create new memory manager implementation
- [x] Update simple examples to use new memory manager
- [x] Document memory management patterns
- [ ] Migrate remaining examples
- [ ] Remove old memory management code

## Phase 2: Vulkan Backend (Next)
- [ ] Create new Vulkan backend structure
- [ ] Implement modern Vulkan 1.3 features
- [ ] Update examples to use new backend
- [ ] Remove old backend code

## Phase 3: Error Handling
- [ ] Define standard error types
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling patterns
- [ ] Update existing code to use new patterns
- [ ] Remove old error handling

## Phase 4: Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create migration guides
- [ ] Improve example documentation
- [ ] Add architecture documentation

## Progress Tracking
Each phase will be tracked in its own issue with subtasks. See:
- Memory Management: #TBD
- Vulkan Backend: #TBD
- Error Handling: #TBD
- Documentation: #TBD

## Testing Strategy
1. Each change must maintain or improve test coverage
2. New implementations must have comprehensive tests
3. Migration paths must be tested
4. Performance benchmarks must be maintained

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Q2 2025 (Current)
- Phase 2: Q3 2025
- Phase 3: Q4 2025
- Phase 4: Q1 2026

## Guidelines for Contributors
1. Always create new code alongside old code
2. Use feature flags to control migrations
3. Document migration paths
4. Keep changes small and focused
5. Maintain backward compatibility
6. Add tests for new code
7. Update documentation

## Code Organization
New code will follow this structure:
```
src/
  graphics/
    backends/
      vulkan/
        new/  # New implementation
        old/  # Legacy code
      common/
    memory/
      new/    # New memory manager
      old/    # Legacy code
```

## Migration Strategy
1. For each component:
   - Create new implementation
   - Add migration helpers
   - Update examples
   - Add tests
   - Document changes
   - Remove old code

2. For each example:
   - Create new version
   - Test thoroughly
   - Update documentation
   - Remove old version

## Completion Criteria
A phase is considered complete when:
1. All new code is implemented and tested
2. All examples are migrated
3. Documentation is updated
4. Old code is removed
5. No regressions in performance
6. All tests pass
